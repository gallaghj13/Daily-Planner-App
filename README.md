# Daily-Planner-App

## Description

I was tasked with adding some html elements, linking them to provided css, and writing the javascript necessary to produce a daily planner. The daily planner has time slots from 9am to 5pm -- normal work hours. Each section has a block where the user can write in an entry for that hour time slot and save it. The time slots are also associated with colors. Green depicts a future time slot, red, a current time slot, and grey, a time in the past. The entries are deleted at the end of the day.

## Usage

The website is fairly intuitive. The time blocks, from left to right, start with a specified time, then an area to write text, and a save button on the end. The current day is also listed in the header.
